- Add a way for the user to specify having at most a certain number of pieces total, rather than exactly that
  number.
    - Maybe ask the user for a min and max.
- Clean up the code a bit, wherever seems necessary.
- When the Stockfish fork is eventually on PyPI, and updated so that mypy can analyze it, import it again for
  this project instead of using models.py directly.
